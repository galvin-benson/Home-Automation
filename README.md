This feature not only enhances convenience but also ensures accessibility for all, including elderly or disabled individuals who may face challenges with manual doors.

Human detection is implemented using a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor, which identifies motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation levels caused by human activity. The PIR sensor is used to control the operation of a fan, automatically turning it on when a person enters the room. This automation eliminates the need for manual intervention, promoting energy efficiency by ensuring that the fan operates only when needed. Additionally, the system allows manual control of the fan, providing users with flexibility in operation.

For light control, the system incorporates an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), which adjusts lighting based on ambient light levels. During nighttime, when light levels fall below a certain threshold and a person is detected in the room, the LDR triggers the lights to turn on automatically. Conversely, during the day, the system ensures that the lights remain off, conserving energy and reducing electricity costs. This feature highlights the project’s emphasis on sustainability and its contribution to eco-friendly living environments.

The entire system is powered by a 12V DC source and relies on a 2-channel relay board to control high-power devices such as fans and lights. The ESP8266 microcontroller, at the core of the system, processes real-time data from the sensors and executes predefined actions based on the conditions detected. This seamless integration of hardware and software creates a cohesive system capable of managing multiple tasks simultaneously.

The project not only addresses convenience but also underscores the importance of safety in home automation. The gas leakage detection mechanism is a prime example of how technology can proactively prevent accidents, safeguarding lives and property. Similarly, the automatic door opening feature enhances security by minimizing the need for physical interaction with the door.

From an energy efficiency perspective, the system’s ability to automate fan and light operation ensures that resources are utilized only when required. By reducing unnecessary power consumption, the project aligns with sustainable development goals and promotes responsible energy usage.

One of the key strengths of this project is its affordability and accessibility. By using readily available components and leveraging the ESP8266 platform, the system can be easily replicated or customized for different home environments. Its modular design also allows for future enhancements, such as the addition of IoT (Internet of Things) capabilities for remote monitoring and control.

In conclusion, the Home Automation and Safety System using ESP8266 is a versatile, cost-effective solution that addresses the essential needs of modern homeowners. By integrating automation, safety, and energy efficiency, the system exemplifies the potential of microcontroller-based solutions in transforming everyday living spaces into smart homes. The project not only simplifies daily tasks but also ensures a secure and sustainable environment, making it an invaluable addition to contemporary living.

Introduction

Home automation systems have become an essential aspect of modern living, providing solutions that improve comfort, safety, and energy efficiency. With the rise of smart technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), automation systems have evolved from being luxury items to practical necessities in both residential and commercial spaces. These systems enhance convenience by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring safety through advanced monitoring, and promoting energy conservation by optimizing resource usage.

This project presents a Home Automation and Safety System designed around an ESP8266 microcontroller, showcasing a simple yet effective way to automate daily activities and ensure household safety. The system integrates multiple sensors and actuators to perform tasks such as automatic light control, fan operation, door opening, and gas leakage detection. These functionalities are executed seamlessly using a network of sensors and relays, demonstrating the capabilities of affordable and accessible microcontroller-based solutions.

One of the key features of the project is gas leakage detection. Gas leaks pose a significant safety risk in households, particularly those using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking or heating. The system uses an MQ-6 smoke detector to monitor the air for the presence of harmful gases. If a leak is detected, the ESP8266 triggers an alarm, alerting occupants immediately. This early warning system provides crucial time to take preventive actions, making it an essential safety feature for modern homes.

Another important functionality of the system is automatic door operation, achieved using an ultrasonic sensor. The sensor measures the distance to nearby objects and detects the presence of individuals near the door. When someone is within a predefined range, the ESP8266 signals the actuator to open the door automatically. This feature enhances convenience and accessibility, particularly for individuals with mobility challenges.

For fan control, the system uses a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, which detects human presence by sensing changes in infrared radiation levels caused by motion. When a person enters the room, the PIR sensor activates the fan automatically, ensuring a comfortable environment. To provide users with greater control, the system also includes a manual override for fan operation, combining automation with flexibility.

The system also incorporates an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to automate light control based on ambient light conditions. During the day, when sufficient natural light is available, the system ensures that the lights remain off, conserving energy. At night, when the ambient light falls below a certain threshold and a person is detected in the room, the lights are turned on automatically. This feature not only reduces electricity consumption but also enhances convenience and security.

All these functionalities are coordinated through the ESP8266 microcontroller, which serves as the central processing unit for the system. The microcontroller processes real-time data from the sensors and executes actions by controlling the connected relays and actuators. The use of a 12V DC power source ensures a stable and efficient energy supply for all components.
